# Vim support for Orc

For users of the [Vim text editor](https://vim.sourceforge.io),
the Orc filetype, filetype plugin, and syntax file are supplied here.

To use these files, place them in your `~/.vim/ftdetect`, `~/.vim/ftplugin`, and `~/.vim/syntax` directories.
(You may need to create these directories.)
