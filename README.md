# Orc Programming editor and IDE support

This repository hosts extensions that enable development of Orc programs using
various programming editor and IDEs.

See the subdirectory for your product (programming editor or IDE) of interest.

The `TextMate` subdirectory is special:
Many other tools (such as GitHub, SublimeText, Visual Studio Code, etc.) parse
TextMate bundles for language definitions.
